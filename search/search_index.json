This amplifier harmoniously blends our classic heritage with modern details: it features refined vacuum tube circuits, which we have enhanced with several additional functionalities. In shaping the overall sound character, our primary goal was to move away from the pronounced coloration often associated with amplifiers utilizing the 300B tube. Instead, we envisioned a smooth, musical and balanced vacuum tube amplifier that excels across the entire audio frequency range.</p>"},{"location":"300b/#technology","title":"Technology","text":""},{"location":"300b/#powered-by-300b","title":"Powered by 300B","text":"<p>The 300B is a directly heated power triode that hardly needs an introduction. Originally developed by Western Electric in the mid-1930s for amplifying audio in movie theaters, it later became a favorite among audiophiles and one of the most successful vacuum tubes in history. Its outstanding sonic properties led us to name our top-of-the-line integrated amplifier after this phenomenal power tube. Its high linearity and low distortion serve as the perfect basis for the amplifier's power block, in which we combine it with our own custom output transformer for excellent low and high frequency behavior. Additionally, we have integrated the newest iteration of our Automatic Bias System for continuous and precise control of the quiescent currents, providing a seamless user experience.</p>"},{"location":"300b/#custom-output-transformers","title":"Custom Output Transformers","text":"<p>The transformers of our amplifiers are custom-designed and built in our in-house transformer workshop. Our output transformers are constructed using high-permeability, large cross-section toroidal magnetic cores, which undergo initial impregnation during the production process. Following this, the winding process begins, utilizing a multi-layered, sectioned, and specially arranged winding configuration. This meticulous design ensures optimal performance across both low and high frequencies. Once the winding is complete, the transformers are encased in metal shielding cans to minimize electromagnetic interference. Finally, they are potted using an epoxy compound to eliminate mechanical vibrations and associated noises.</p>"},{"location":"300b/#custom-power-transformer","title":"Custom Power Transformer","text":"<p>Just like our output transformers, our power transformers are also custom-designed and built in our in-house transformer workshop. We manufacture them with the same precision and attention to details: the high-permeability, large cross-section toroidal cores are also impregnated, and then the winding process follows. The parameters of the windings are designed to avoid saturation of the magnetic core and to ensure efficient operation even under heavy load conditions. It is important to note that we use double electromagnetic shielding for our power transformers. Finally, we employ the same epoxy compound used to pot the output transformers to eliminate mechanical vibrations and associated noises.</p>"},{"location":"300b/#automatic-bias-system","title":"Automatic Bias System","text":"<p>This circuit continuously monitors the behavior of each tube and regulates the bias voltages accordingly, ensuring the smallest possible output voltage noise while guaranteeing the highest degree of linearity of the output stage. Additionally, it prevents the sensitive, high-permeability output transformer cores from saturating by precisely equalizing the quiescent currents of the power tubes. Furthermore, the bias system incorporates a built-in soft-start function, which prevents the tubes from drawing excessive current during start-up and eliminates pops and noises. The result is that no further adjustment is required once the electron tubes supplied with the unit have been installed; the Automatic Bias System takes care of everything.</p>"},{"location":"300b/#filament-soft-start","title":"Filament Soft-Start","text":"<p>To significantly extend the lifetime of the power tubes, we have implemented the Filament Soft-Start feature, which limits the current flowing through the heating filaments to a safe level during start-up when the tubes are cold. The transient current of a 300B's cold filament can exceed eight times the nominal heating current, which poses a risk of damaging the expensive power tubes in a short time. Therefore, each of the filaments of the 300B's is fed from its own stabilized DC power supply, and the soft-start circuit ensures that the transient current in each filament remains well below 2 Amperes throughout start-up, providing sufficient protection for the tubes.</p>"},{"location":"300b/#highly-optimized-layout","title":"Highly Optimized Layout","text":"<p>During the design phase, a significant amount of engineering time was devoted to the layout details of the whole integrated amplifier. Our top priority was to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and completely eliminate mains related signal components from the audio frequency spectrum. To achieve this, we separated the audio circuits as much as possible from the power supplies that cause the most electromagnetic interference. Additionally, we repackaged a substantial portion of the internal structure of the amplifier. By utilizing our highest-quality printed circuit boards, we have created a modular, robust, and high-performance layout.</p>"},{"location":"300b/#pragmatic-audio-design","title":"Pragmatic Audio Design","text":"<p>In terms of audio design, we firmly believe that:</p> <ul> <li>A really good tube amplifier should be compatible with as many loudspeakers as possible.</li> <li>A well-designed tube amplifier should exhibit Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) below 0.5% across the entire power spectrum, from milliwatts to rated power, spanning 20 Hz to 20 kHz.</li> <li>Ideally, the THD vs. Frequency plot should remain flat when measured at a fixed output power. </li> <li>The transient response should remain fast and controlled throughout the entire audio range, which goes hand in hand with the frequency response being wide and flat. </li> <li>A tube amplifier can have low noise and an exceptional signal-to-noise ratio. </li> <li>Thoughtful work, good technical parameters and excellent sound quality can coexist in a high-end tube amplifier.</li> </ul> <p>In the preamplifier and driver sections, the 12AX7 and 12AT7 tubes play a crucial role in achieving these goals.

We felt that this little play on words faithfully reflects everything that our current products also represent: the high quality intermediary role of our audio components that forges a very close bond between the piece of music and the listener during a listening session.</p> <p>As manufacturers, our role is twofold: we are both creators and passionate music lovers. As creators, we define with our product what we think an audio amplifier should be. In this role, we do our job well if there are many people who enjoy listening to music on our components, if they also consider the same things important in a sound reproduction that we do. If they had to make an amplifier from scratch, they would build one with the same sonic character. This is the point where the circle closes and the creator becomes listener again.</p> <p>An authentic musician writes his own songs because he wants to listen to good music, music that he thinks is the best. We started making amplifiers of our own design for the same reason: we didn't really find any currently manufactured audio amplifier on the market that we ourselves would have liked to use in our own system. In the end, we found a sophisticated and captivating sound character in our vacuum tube models, which we want to bring to as many audio enthusiasts as possible.</p> <p>For many of us, the devices we use to listen to music are of paramount importance, since a carefully designed audio system not only does not disturb the listening experience, but also enhances and deepens it. In this sense, systems containing vacuum tube elements are often characterized by the words: warm, natural, detailed, open, clear, etc. In practice, the situation is obviously more complex, but these descriptions generally apply to well-designed tube amplifiers. All of this is connected to the aesthetic and technical nostalgia of electron tubes, which is inseparably present in such an audio device.</p> <p>Finally, we would like to share some of the principles that we have kept in mind from the very beginning, and which represent the cornerstones of the company's culture:</p> <ul> <li>The most important characteristic of the product is the quality of sound reproduction.</li> <li>Always be empathetic towards users, take their feedback and comments into account, and adapt to their needs.</li> <li>Honest, self-explanatory, easy-to-use products.</li> <li>Aesthetic neutrality, simplicity, clean appearance.</li> <li>High build quality, structured layout, built to stand the test of time.</li> <li>Out of the box thinking, original solutions.</li> <li>Continuous learning, development and self-reflection, review of processes.</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"phono/","title":"Phono Preamplifier","text":""},{"location":"reviews/","title":"Reviews","text":""},{"location":"service/","title":"Service Repair","text":""},{"location":"service/#germany","title":"Germany","text":"<p>AVS Oymann Auf der Schanz 31 47652 Weeze-Wemb, Germany +49 2837 669862  </p>"},{"location":"service/#united-states","title":"United States","text":"<p>Just Audio 11615 Crossroads Cir Suite A Middle River, MD 21220, USA +1 410-882-4360</p>"},{"location":"story/","title":"Our Story","text":""},{"location":"story/#professional-audio-roots","title":"Professional audio roots","text":"<p>The production of electroacoustic equipment has a long history in Hungary, including the city of Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za in Eastern-Hungary, where qualiton amplifiers are made. In the turbulent years following World War II, a state-owned company called RAFILM from Budapest was initially responsible for meeting both professional and home audio needs in the country. In 1951, the name of the company was first changed to AUDIO, and then to EAG in 1956. However, they couldn\u2019t use this name for too long due to its great similarity to the German company AEG. Consequently, in 1960, the name was changed to BEAG, which stands for Budapesti Elektroakusztikai Gy\u00e1r.</p> <p> </p> <p>BEAG placed increasing emphasis on the production of professional studio equipment and established a production plant in our city in 1971.

According to news reports at the time, the company had to manufacture 80 complete radio studios, sound equipment for 21 color TV studios, workstations for approximately 2,600 commentators and 264 technicians, among many other audio engineering tasks. This was a huge challenge, but they were very proud of the fact that every device delivered could have the BEAG Hungary badge on it.</p> <p> </p> <p>After the large-scale Olympic project, the company continued to manufacture its products for the markets of the Eastern Bloc.

UNIVOX aimed to continue manufacturing the existing product range and further develop it based on customer needs.

With this move we were able to save this precious heritage and continue the tradition of audio manufacturing in Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za.</p> <p>The merger of the two companies also meant that we continued to employ the experienced professionals of Univox, and all in all, we made a jump of several years by taking over the management of a factory with a long tradition, saving the time of building a new factory from scratch, as well as the time required to train all employees. We added young and ambitious engineers to the design team, thus creating a healthy combination of experience and fresh thinking. The team has been agile and open-minded ever since, and this made it easier to overcome difficulties and makes product development a great adventure.</p> <p>Thanks to this approach, we were able to release our first products (the APX 200 power amplifier and the APR 204 preamplifier) after a short development period, and these products were immediately very well received within the high-end audio scene.
